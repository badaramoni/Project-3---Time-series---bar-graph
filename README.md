#Project-3---Time-series---bar-graph
This project is an interactive bar graph visualization created using Processing. The graph displays a dataset of daily minimum temperatures over time.

#Features
Proper spacing and centering for axis labels.
Generation of tick marks and proper labeling for data dimensions.
Rectangle bar graph for data encoding.
Proper title of the graph at the top.
Interactive feature to hover over a bar and display the value on top of the bar.
#How to run
Install Processing.
Open the BarGraphProject.pde file in the Processing IDE.
Ensure your dataset is in the CSV format and the file path is updated in the setup() function.
Press the Run button (or press Ctrl+R) to run the sketch.
#Data format
The expected dataset format is a CSV file with two columns: "Date" and "Daily minimum temperatures". 
The "Date" column should contain date strings in the format "M/D/YYYY", and the "Daily minimum temperatures" 
column should contain temperature values as floating-point numbers.
